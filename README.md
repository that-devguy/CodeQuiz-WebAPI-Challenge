# CodeQuiz-WebAPI-Challenge
OSU Bootcamp - Week 4 Homework Challenge

In this week's Challenge I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HMML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It includes a polished and responsive user interface.
